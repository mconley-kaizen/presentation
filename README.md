# How I Use Docker for Data Science
## Developing Models for Deployment

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have a working version of `docker` on your machine.  Installation instructions for all major platforms can be found on the [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/install_the_platform) website.

You should be able to execute `docker --version` and see something like `Docker version 1.10.3, build 20f81dd` 

If you are on linux, installation is very straight forward as `docker` takes advantage of the host's native kernel

If you are on Mac or Windows, you will need to use the `docker-machine` tools provided in the installation to run `docker` on a virtual machine.  This is somewhat seamless, just follow the [tutorials](https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/install_the_platform)


### Play with it
Take a look at the [Hello World](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerizing/) tutorial on [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerizing/)

See what `docker ps`, `docker logs`, and `docker stop` do...


### Development

You can view the presentation in [Presentation.ipynb](https://github.com/mconley-kaizen/presentation/blob/master/Presentation.ipynb)

We'll be using the repos:
* [webapp](https://github.com/mconley-kaizen/webapp)
* [dockerapp](https://github.com/mconley-kaizen/docker_app)
* [iris_prediction](https://github.com/mconley-kaizen/iris_prediction)
* [deploy](https://github.com/mconley-kaizen/deploy)

Don't worry too much about what is in these repos just yet, but some familiarity will help.


### Usage
If `docker` is properly installed, the workflow below will work

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mconley-kaizen/dockerapp.git
cd dockerapp
docker build -t mydockerapp .
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/mconley-kaizen/deploy.git
cd deploy
source launch.sh
deploy 5000 iris_prediction predict mydockerapp
```

If executed correctly, there should be a webapp running on port 5000 of your `docker` network.  If you are on linux, your `docker` network will be your host computer.  If you are using `docker-machine`, the command `docker-machine ip` will return your docker network, ie:  `chrome $(docker-machine ip):5000`
